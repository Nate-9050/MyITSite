            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Nate and I'm learning about networking, basic coding, Linux, & more. I received a certificate in Applied IT although it was several years ago. I currently work in engineering/drafting but I spend my free time keeping up with the IT Industry.</p>
	       I have some basic skills in VBA, HTML, and Python but I have a long way to go. I know this is very simple and basic but I wanted to get something out there.
